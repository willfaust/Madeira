# Building Madeira from a clean checkout (reproducibility record, 2026-09-16)

This is the "scripts to control compilation and installation" record the
LGPL relink obligation depends on (docs/LICENSING.md). Each step says
whether it has been re-executed from a clean checkout. A fresh recursive
clone of the repository at commit 8a8cabe was tested on 2026-09-16 (with
the submodule URLs redirected to the local forks, since nothing is pushed):
the app target does NOT build from the clone alone, because the inputs
marked "not in the repository" below are absent. Two further findings:
`app/Madeira/x86_64-vcruntime` is required by the project but ignored, and
the submodule commits (FEX, its nested rpmalloc fork, wine branch
`madeira-lgpl`, dxmt) exist only locally: the forks named in `.gitmodules`
(all under github.com/willfaust) do not yet carry them, so a recipient's
recursive clone fails at the first submodule until every fork is pushed. This document is the
remediation; steps marked UNVERIFIED have not yet been re-run from scratch.

## Native build chains (all in the repository)

Run in this order after the inputs above are in place. Outputs are
git-ignored and consumed by the app project.

1. `build/gnutls-ios/build.sh`: GMP 6.3.0, Nettle 3.10.1, GnuTLS 3.8.9 from
   the tracked tarballs in `build/gnutls-ios/src` (SHA256SUMS there) ->
   `app/Madeira/lib{gmp,nettle,hogweed,gnutls}.a` (these four outputs are
   also tracked). Verified: built on the development machine; not re-run
   from a clean checkout.
   `build/ffmpeg/build.sh`: FFmpeg 7.1.1 in an LGPL-only configuration (WMA,
   MPEG audio and PCM decoders; mp3/wav/mov demuxers; no H.264/HEVC/AAC),
   built from the tracked, unmodified release tarball in `build/ffmpeg/src`
   after verifying it against `build/ffmpeg/src/SHA256SUMS` -> headers in `toolchains/ffmpeg-ios/include`
   (read by `build/ntdll-unix/build.sh` for winegstreamer's unix side) and
   `app/Madeira/lib{avformat,avcodec,swresample,avutil}.a` (ignored; the app
   target links them together with VideoToolbox, CoreMedia, CoreVideo,
   AudioToolbox and CoreFoundation). The configure arguments are the ones the
   port was built and device-tested with on the WSL toolchain; the macOS form
   of the script is UNVERIFIED.
2. FEX (submodule, branch ios-port-2607):
   - `FEX/build-ios`: `build/fex-ios/build.sh` (same options as the development CMakeCache) -> `FEX/build-ios/FEXCore/Source/lib{FEXCore,FEXCore_Base,JemallocLibs}.a` and the `External/{cephes,fmt,SoftFloat-3e,xxhash}` archives. UNVERIFIED from clean.
   - `FEX/build-arm64ec`: `build/fex-arm64ec/build.sh` (configures with `FEX/Data/CMake/toolchain_mingw.cmake` and the recorded options on first run, builds target `arm64ecfex`, copies `Bin/libarm64ecfex.dll` to `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/xtajit64.dll`). The build step was verified this session; the first-run configure in the script is reconstructed from CMakeCache and UNVERIFIED.
3. Wine (submodule, branch madeira-lgpl):
   - unix side: `build/ntdll-unix/build.sh`, `build/wineserver/build.sh`,
     `build/win32u-unix/build.sh` -> `app/Madeira/lib{ntdll_unix,wineserver,win32u_unix}.a`. Verified on the development machine.
   - PE side: `build/wine-pe/build-ntdll.sh` (configures `wine/build-arm64ec` with `--enable-archs=arm64ec --without-x --disable-tests --enable-winegstreamer` on first run, builds `dlls/ntdll`, strips, pads to SizeOfImage + 0x50000, copies to the app). Other PE modules: `build/wine-pe/build-modules.sh <name>...` (same tree; it builds each module's DLL target `dlls/<name>/arm64ec-windows/<name>.dll`, strips it with `--strip-debug` like every shipped builtin and installs it into `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/`, or into `$DEST`). Building the DLL target rather than `make -C dlls/<name>` is also what winegstreamer needs (enabled by `--enable-winegstreamer` although GStreamer is absent, since its unix side is `build/ntdll-unix/winegstreamer_unixlib_ios.c`). Without arguments the script rebuilds the stock builtins added for games: `cryptsp`, `d3dx11_43`, `msvcp110`, `msvcr110` and `xaudio2_7` (committed in `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/` like every other builtin). It needs bison 3 for `tools/wrc` (macOS ships 2.3; Homebrew's is used when installed). The strip/pad step was verified this session; the configure step is UNVERIFIED from clean; build-modules.sh reproduced the five default DLLs at their shipped sizes on the development machine (2026-10-03).
   - `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/` is the DLL farm: every file in it is linked into the prefix (`system32` for x64 sessions, and `sysx64`), so a Wine module is only available if it was built and copied there. The native D3D12 path needs two stock modules in addition to the existing ones: `dcomp.dll` (`make -C dlls/dcomp`; a 64-bit Godot 4 engine loads it before it creates its D3D12 device, and gives up on D3D12 without it) and `ktmw32.dll` (`make -C dlls/ktmw32`; an optional import the same engine probes).
4. DXMT (submodule, branch ios-port):
   - unix side: `build/dxmt-ios/build.sh` (needs `toolchains/llvm-ios-build`) -> `app/Madeira/libdxmt_combined.a` (ignored; the app links it). Verified this session.
   - PE side: `meson setup dxmt/build-arm64ec dxmt -Dbuildtype=release -Dwine_build_path=../../wine/build-arm64ec --cross-file=dxmt/build-arm64ec-win.txt` then `ninja -C dxmt/build-arm64ec src/winemetal/winemetal.dll` (and d3d11.dll) -> copied to `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/`. Verified this session (winemetal.dll).
4b. In-app pairing (Built-in StikJIT on iOS 27): `build/rppairing-ios/build.sh`
   (Rust with the `aarch64-apple-ios` target; crates from crates.io at the
   versions in `build/rppairing-ios/Cargo.lock`) -> `app/Madeira/libmadeira_rppairing.a`
   (ignored; the app links it) and the bundled crate notices
   `app/Madeira/legal/LICENSES-rppairing-crates.txt` (tracked). `cargo test`
   in that folder runs its host tests. Verified on the development machine.
5. Native D3D12 runtime: `build/madeira-d3d12/build-pe.sh` -> `d3d12.dll`, `madeira_d3d12.dll` and the test executables in `app/Madeira/arm64ec-windows/` (tracked). Verified this session. `build/madeira-d3d12/fetch-converter.sh` re-verifies the converter library; `build/stage-licenses.sh` refreshes the bundled licence copies (the Xcode build fails if they are stale).
5b. OpenGL (optional): `build/mesa-d3d12/build.sh` builds Mesa's Windows x64
   D3D12 driver from the pinned tarball with `build/mesa-d3d12/patches/` and
   writes `opengl32.dll`, `libgallium_wgl.dll` and the fetched `dxil.dll`
   (with `LICENSE-dxil.txt`) to `app/Madeira/x86_64-opengl/` (ignored). Needs
   bison 3, ninja, and uv or `python3 -m venv` for Meson and Mako. Meson cannot
   download (`--wrap-mode=nodownload`), and two clean builds give the same
   bytes. `tests/host/check-mesa-fence-fallback.py` checks the fence patch
   against the built tree. At session start WineProcessBridge.m links these
   DLLs over Wine's opengl32 stub for x64 games (`env.MADEIRA_OPENGL = 0`
   keeps the stub); without them nothing changes. Verified on the development
   machine 2026-10-06.
6. App: `xcodebuild -project app/Madeira.xcodeproj -scheme Madeira -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -allowProvisioningUpdates build` (Debug is the configuration that runs the games; Release builds have crashed the guest), then zip `Payload/Madeira.app` into an IPA and sideload. Verified this session on the development machine.
7. WoW64 (32-bit programs, optional): `build/wine-i386/build.sh` (i386 Wine farm
   -> `app/Madeira/i386-windows/`), `build/fex-wow64/build.sh` (FEX WOW64 module
   -> `app/Madeira/aarch64-windows/xtajit.dll`) and the aarch64 `wow64.dll` /
   `wow64win.dll`; see docs/WOW64.md, "Building". UNVERIFIED on macOS.

## Status of the LGPL relink question

A recipient of a built package can obtain the complete corresponding
source of every LGPL library (Wine fork, GnuTLS, Nettle, GMP, FFmpeg) from the
repository, and the application source and build scripts above. Whether
they can actually relink depends on assembling the "not in the repository"
inputs and re-executing the UNVERIFIED steps; that end-to-end clean-machine
rebuild, signing and installation has NOT been performed. Until it is,
docs/LICENSING.md keeps the relink capability marked unverified. The
alternative the LGPL offers, shipping the application's object files, is
not currently done.
